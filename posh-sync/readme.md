# Posh Sync

## Goals

- Write Syncer in PowerShell
- Write it as functionally as possible
- Use strengths of pwsh (e.g. pipeline)
- Find a stratified design (a la _Grokking Simplicity_)

## Functionality

- Sync settings
  - VS Code
  - WS Term
- Sync installed apps
  - Scoop
- Exclude items from syncing
- Allow to resolve merge conflicts
- Running manually is fine, no need for auto syncing
